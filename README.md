# dog breed classifier using Pytorch

This project uses pytorch pretrained deep learning models for the classification of 133 different dog breeds. The dataset can be found here: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip

for a walk through of the precedure involved in developing the final model, please refer to this article https://medium.com/@terryobinnadonatus/udacity-dog-breed-classifier-project-6f44214ec017?sk=2c1473ea9877583082e7848fcae5efe8

## API
This repo also contains the API implementation of this project which can be found in the API folder of this repo. The API was implemented using Flask. All modules reqiured to successfully set up the API can be found in <i>requirements.txt</i>.

The pytorch version found in the <i>requirements.txt</i> is the CPU only version, if you intend to run the application on a with GPU, please make sure to install the GPU version of Pytorch from https://pytorch.org/
